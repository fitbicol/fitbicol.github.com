							<h1>Whey Protein Gold Standard</h1>
							<p>Whey protein is popular with active adults because it digests rapidly and is a rich source of amino acids for muscle recovery. Whey protein isolates are the purest form of whey and the primary ingredient in Gold Standard 100% Whey. Each serving provides 24 grams of rapidly digesting whey protein with low levels of fat, cholesterol, lactose and other stuff you can do without. There's no doubt this is the standard all other proteins are measured against.</p>

							<h2>What does it do?</h2>
							<p>Muscle is actually broken down during your workout. Afterwards, during the recovery period, your body uses protein to repair the muscle fibres. The whey proteins in Gold Standard 100% Whey are absorbed into your system to support recovery and aid muscle growth.</p>

							<h2>When is the best time to take this product?</h2>
							<p>Gold Standard 100% Whey is best enjoyed first thing in the morning and/or during the 30 minutes just before or immediately after training. Simply mix one rounded scoop with 6-8 oz (180-240ml) of your favourite beverage in your ON shaker. </p>

							<p>No wonder it’s been voted Supplement of the Year and Protein Powder of the Year again in the annual BodyBuilding.com Supplement Awards!</p>

							<h1>Casein Gold Standard</h1>
							<p>Faster digesting amino acids are desirable immediately before and after exercise to help refuel recovering muscles, but slow digestion and absorption may be more beneficial at other times – including bedtime when your body typically goes for hours without food.</p>

							<h2>What does it do?</h2>
							<p>Used together, Gold Standard 100% Whey and Gold Standard 100% Casein deliver 24 hour muscle support.</p>

							<h2>When is the best time to take this product?</h2>
							<p>Casein is best taken at night, as this is when the majority of muscle rebuilding takes place. Simply add one rounded scoop to 10-12 oz (300-360ml) of water, milk or your favourite drink in an ON shaker half an hour before bed.</p>
